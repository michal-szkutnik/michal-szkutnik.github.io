After upgrade to Windows 10 the thumbnails failed to generate for most of the files. Ultimately I uninstalled SageThumbs and was left with no CR2 thumbnails. After some digging it turned out I was missing a ShellEx registry entry pointing to Windows built in thumbnail generator for CR2 files. If your CR2 files are missing thumbnails in File Explorer and no tips found on the internet seem to fix it, maybe it's the same issue. Check if your HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.cr2 key looks like that (especially the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.cr2\\ShellEx\\{e357fccd-a995-4576-b01f-234630154e96} key):\r\n\r\n    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\r\n      \r\n    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.cr2]\r\n    @=\"Canon RAW File\"\r\n    \"PerceivedType\"=\"image\"\r\n    \"Content Type\"=\"image/cr2\"\r\n      \r\n    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.cr2\\ShellEx]\r\n      \r\n    [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.cr2\\ShellEx\\{e357fccd-a995-4576-b01f-234630154e96}]\r\n    @=\"{C7657C4A-9F68-40fa-A4DF-96BC08EB3551}\"\r\n\r\nIf not, adding these values and restarting the machine might fix your problem.
